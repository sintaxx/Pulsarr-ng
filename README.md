Pulsarr
=======

Browser extension (currently [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pulsarr/dcildkalkckjjdfpgagmnbbfooogopkd) & [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ffpulsarr)) for adding movies to Radarr or Series' to Sonarr while browsing IMDB or TVDB.

## What's New
- Cleaned up the API endpoints to the newer format Radarr/Sonarr uses.
- Fixed IMDB URL regex detection for popup.
- Fixed displaying poster in the popup.

## What works?
- Extension popup loads
- Extension popup allows and saves connection to your Radarr server.
- Detects if movie already exists


## Current features
- Add movies to [Radarr](https://radarr.video) or Series' to [Sonarr](https://sonarr.tv) while browsing various websites (IMDB, TVDB and Trakt).

## WIP
- Need to fix Chrome specifics.
- Need to check/validate TVDB functionality.
- Adding movies you don't have in your library.
